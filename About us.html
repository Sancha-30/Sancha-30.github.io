    <p> About GitHub's APIs
        GitHub provides two APIs: a REST API and a GraphQL API. You can interact with both APIs using GitHub CLI, curl, the official Octokit libraries, and third party libraries. Occasionally, a feature may be supported on one API but not the other.
        
        You should use the API that best aligns with your needs and that you are most comfortable using.</p>
        <p> You don't need to exclusively use one API over the other. Node IDs let you move between the REST API and GraphQL API. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/using-global-node-ids">Using global node IDs</a></p>
